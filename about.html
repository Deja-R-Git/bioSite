			<h3>His Career</h3>
			<img src="images\Screenshot 2025-06-18 223343.png" alt="Portrait of Nathaniel" style="width:33%">
			<p>Nathaniel Alexander Jackson is a Human Resources Specialist at the City of Balch Springs in Texas. He is passionate about mental health and being a healthy mentor and role model to others around him. As a kid Nathaniel wanted to be a contract lawyer when he grew up to help people negotiate for better quality of life for themselves. Although that is not where he ended up, his mission to provide services to others that are supportive and caring translated into the career he has today. Nathan married Jasmine on June 23rd, 2023 after 2 years of dating. He described it as "a most joyous time. I was surrounded by friends and family. My wife Jasmine and I were lifted in love and we made a vow to always choose one another every single day." He had become so overwhelmed with emotion that he "cried a lot. Happily."
